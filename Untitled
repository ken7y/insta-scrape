So basically the x-instagram-gis persists so far now that its 2 days in

basically I gotta do a perl version of curl. But I need to get the x-instagram gis
So I need to grab that off somewhere.

The url is fine because thats a url decode and it will look something like https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query/?query_hash=e0f59e4a1c8d78d0161873bc2ee7ec44
&variables={"shortcode":"BoVqWT8AqRh","include_reel":true,"first":24}  but in url encoded

So the current problem is where do i get the x-instagram-gis and once I do

I need to do a ruby curl that of the url above with header user agent and xinstagis

and once I do that, it'll be an easy life.

New problem. Whenever a new set of likers are loaded theres a new x-instagram-gis

someone posted this
Anonymous graphql requests now need a
 valid query_hash, csrf_token and a header x-instagram-gis set to the md5 hash of rhx_gis + ":" + csrf_token + ":" + user agent + ":" + variables.

Here's a working example for whoever wants to
implement a fix: https://gist.github.com/marcoqu/e17e1c4414f8d18e6672976d941161fa

alright so the rhx_gis is found in the base html page of the profile.
Just html scrape the page and grep for a rhx_gis
the md5hash should be rhx_gis:variables
